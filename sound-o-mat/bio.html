	There's no dearth of online advice and information about audio engineering, but being proud of every project I've been involved with, I'll share some of the things that worked for me. Keep in mind this has always been a side job &amp; hobby, not a career, so YMMV.<br><br>
	There's only one thing I'd go back and change: making sure to get printed credit (with contact info) for any work done on all printed packaging, digital artwork, websites, etc. It was part of my standard contract but I shoud have put in a financial penalty to make sure it was done.<br><br>
	In any creative business, word-of-mouth and networking is where the majority of work comes from. A number of my clients contacted me because of work I'd done on releases they'd heard and been impressed by. Sometimes artists and labels forget credits as they rush to get releases out the door. It's never malicious; it's just a minor detail easily forgotten.<br><br>
	As to what I think makes for a good audio engineer, technical skill and knowledge are key, but soft skills such as communication, understanding, flexibility and open-mindedness are just as important.<br><br>
	An engineer's only job is to help artists realize their vision and achieve their goals, whether or not one agrees with all the choices. If you get what they're doing many welcome input, but not all do. To produce meaningful work: check your ego, ask questions and listen. Great engineers, managers and leaders say little, ask a lot and do everything they can to satisfy their customers.<br><br>
	I've worked well with every client because my <i>only</i> goal is to make <i>their</i> desires a reality. Every style of music is fantastic in its own way, and while it may not be something you dig, there's many who do and by doing your best, you're helping make others happy. It's the most important thing that never factors into a paycheck, but pays off in ways that don't convert directly to dollars.<br><br>
	On the technical side of things, read as much as you can but in particular, subscribe to <a href="https://soundonsound.com">Sound-on-Sound</a>. Their writers are smart, snarky &amp; fun but most off all they're the best source of real info w/o the taint of advertisers, company reps, etc. I consider them the Consumer Reports of the audio world and I've never read an article from them that wasn't extremely helpful. Their archives are extensive and well worth perusing. Start here: <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/yamaha-ns10-story">The Yamaha NS10 Story</a>. Also worthwhile is <a href="https://tapeop.com">Tape Op</a>.<br><br>
	Another tidbit: 5% of your clients will cause 95% of your headaches. Don't be afraid to say "no" and let a client go free of charge. The vast majority of musicians out there are highly interesting, educated and talented people, but focus on the ones who want to work with you. Never try to force a relationship to make money. If you're good at what you do, you'll never lack for paying customers.<br><br>
	Finally, having a sense of humor is a must and it never hurts to know a few good jokes. Here's my all-time favorite:<br><i>What did the drummer say to the band right before getting kicked out?</i><br><br>
	    "<i>Hey guys, listen to this song I just wrote</i>!"<br>(don't @me, some of my good friends are drummers)</p>
